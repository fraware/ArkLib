## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ArkLib seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

### Reporting Process

1. **Email Security Team**: Send an email to [security@arklib.org](mailto:security@arklib.org) with the subject line `[SECURITY] [COMPONENT] Brief description of vulnerability`

2. **Include Details**: Provide as much information as possible, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

3. **Response Timeline**: You can expect an initial response within 48 hours and regular updates on the progress of fixing the vulnerability.

4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We follow a coordinated disclosure process:
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
   - We will investigate and provide updates on our progress
   - We will coordinate the release of security fixes
   - We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### What to Report

- **Cryptographic vulnerabilities**: Any issues that could compromise the security of cryptographic protocols
- **Formal verification failures**: Gaps in proofs that could lead to incorrect implementations
- **Build system vulnerabilities**: Issues in CI/CD, dependencies, or build processes
- **Supply chain attacks**: Compromised dependencies or toolchain components
- **Access control issues**: Unauthorized access to repository or deployment systems

### What NOT to Report

- **Feature requests**: Use GitHub issues for new features
- **Bug reports**: Use GitHub issues for non-security bugs
- **Documentation issues**: Use GitHub issues for documentation problems
- **Performance issues**: Use GitHub issues for performance concerns (unless they create security risks)

## Security Measures

### Code Review Process

- All code changes require review by at least one maintainer
- Security-sensitive changes require review by multiple maintainers
- Automated security scanning is performed on all pull requests

### Dependency Management

- Dependabot is enabled for automatic dependency updates
- All dependencies are regularly audited for known vulnerabilities
- Critical dependencies are pinned to specific versions

### Build Security

- GitHub Actions workflows use least-privilege permissions
- All third-party actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs
- Build artifacts are signed and verified

### Formal Verification

- All cryptographic components must have complete formal proofs
- No `sorry` or `admit` statements are allowed in production code
- Automated theorem proving is used where possible

## Security Advisories

When we release fixes for security vulnerabilities, we will:

1. **Publish a security advisory** on GitHub with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Severity rating
   - Affected versions
   - Steps to upgrade
   - Credits to reporters

2. **Release patched versions** with security fixes

3. **Notify users** through appropriate channels

## Responsible Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1**: Acknowledgment and initial assessment
- **Day 7**: Status update and estimated fix timeline
- **Day 30**: Target for fix completion (may vary based on complexity)
- **Day 31**: Security advisory published and fix released

## Security Team

The ArkLib security team consists of:

- **Security Lead**: [TBD]
- **Cryptographic Review**: [TBD]
- **Build Security**: [TBD]
- **Formal Verification**: [TBD]

## Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we do provide:

- Recognition in security advisories
- Contributor credits in our documentation
- Special acknowledgment for significant security contributions

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**: API keys, passwords, or private keys
2. **Use secure dependencies**: Always check for known vulnerabilities
3. **Write secure proofs**: Ensure all cryptographic properties are formally verified
4. **Follow least privilege**: Use minimal permissions in CI/CD workflows
5. **Report vulnerabilities**: If you find a security issue, report it immediately

## Contact Information

- **Security Email**: [security@arklib.org](mailto:security@arklib.org)
- **PGP Key**: [TBD]
- **Emergency Contact**: [TBD]

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the security researchers and contributors who have helped improve the security of ArkLib through responsible disclosure.
