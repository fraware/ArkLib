## 🚫 **Issues NOT in Scope (Complex Cryptographic Problems)**

The following issues are **excluded** from this focused plan due to their complexity and long-term nature:

- **CR-001: Extensive Use of `sorry` Placeholders** - Requires deep cryptographic expertise
- **HI-001: Fragile Proof Scripts** - Requires proof automation expertise  
- **HI-002: Incomplete Cryptographic Implementations** - Requires formal verification expertise

These will be addressed in future phases with specialized teams and longer timelines.
