# ArkLib Security, Correctness & Performance Risk Register

## Executive Summary
This document catalogs all identified security vulnerabilities, correctness issues, and performance bottlenecks in the ArkLib repository, prioritized by severity and impact on verification guarantees.

## Risk Severity Levels
- **Critical (P0)**: Immediate security vulnerability or correctness failure that compromises the entire system
- **High (P0)**: Significant security gap or correctness issue that could lead to system compromise
- **Medium (P1)**: Performance issue or minor correctness concern that impacts usability
- **Low (P2)**: Documentation or minor optimization opportunity

## Critical Issues (P0)

### CR-001: Extensive Use of `sorry` Placeholders
- **Component**: Core cryptographic components
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Evidence**: 50+ instances of `sorry` across critical modules:
  - `ArkLib/AGM/Basic.lean`: 5 instances
  - `ArkLib/ProofSystem/Sumcheck/Basic.lean`: 15+ instances
  - `ArkLib/OracleReduction/Composition/Virtual.lean`: 7 instances
  - `ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/MerkleTree.lean`: 6 instances
- **Impact**: Complete loss of formal verification guarantees
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace with proper proofs or mark as TODO with tracking
- **Owner**: Core development team

### CR-002: Missing SECURITY.md File
- **Component**: Repository security posture
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Evidence**: No SECURITY.md file found in repository
- **Impact**: No coordinated disclosure process for security vulnerabilities
- **Recommended Fix**: Create comprehensive SECURITY.md with disclosure process
- **Owner**: Repository maintainers

### CR-003: GitHub Actions Security Vulnerabilities
- **Component**: CI/CD workflows
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Evidence**: 
  - Actions not pinned to commit SHAs
  - Overly permissive permissions (pages: write, id-token: write)
  - No branch protection rules visible
- **Impact**: Potential supply chain attacks and unauthorized deployments
- **Recommended Fix**: Pin all actions to SHAs, implement least-privilege permissions
- **Owner**: DevOps team

### CR-004: Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities
- **Component**: Documentation site dependencies
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Evidence**: 
  - `activesupport` 8.0.2 (known vulnerabilities)
  - `github-pages` 232 (outdated)
  - Multiple outdated gems in Gemfile.lock
- **Impact**: Website security compromise, potential supply chain attacks
- **Recommended Fix**: Update all dependencies, enable Dependabot for all ecosystems
- **Owner**: Documentation team

## High Issues (P0)

### HI-001: Fragile Proof Scripts with Global `simp`
- **Component**: Proof automation
- **Severity**: High
- **Evidence**: Extensive use of global `simp` without `[only]` restrictions
- **Impact**: Potential proof failures, maintenance difficulties
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace with `simp [only]` and add specialized lemmas
- **Owner**: Proof development team

### HI-002: Incomplete Cryptographic Component Implementations
- **Component**: Core cryptographic protocols
- **Severity**: High
- **Evidence**: 
  - Merkle tree security proofs incomplete
  - Sumcheck/Spartan implementations have missing proofs
  - Commitment scheme security properties unproven
- **Impact**: Cryptographic security cannot be guaranteed
- **Recommended Fix**: Complete all security proofs or document assumptions
- **Owner**: Cryptographic implementation team

### HI-003: Lean Toolchain Pinning Issues
- **Component**: Build reproducibility
- **Severity**: High
- **Evidence**: 
  - Lean 4.18.0 pinned (not latest)
  - Lake dependencies may have reproducibility issues
- **Impact**: Build failures, potential security issues from outdated toolchain
- **Recommended Fix**: Upgrade to latest stable Lean version, audit Lake reproducibility
- **Owner**: Build system team

## Medium Issues (P1)

### MI-001: Performance Bottlenecks in Proof Automation
- **Component**: Proof performance
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Evidence**: Heavy use of `aesop`, large unification goals, aggressive `simp`
- **Impact**: Slow compilation, poor developer experience
- **Recommended Fix**: Profile and optimize proof automation, add specialized lemmas
- **Owner**: Performance optimization team

### MI-002: Incomplete Documentation Alignment
- **Component**: Documentation and code consistency
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Evidence**: Blueprint may not align with actual theorem implementations
- **Impact**: Misleading documentation, maintenance difficulties
- **Recommended Fix**: Validate documentation against code, fix discrepancies
- **Owner**: Documentation team

## Low Issues (P2)

### LI-001: Style and Linting Inconsistencies
- **Component**: Code quality
- **Severity**: Low
- **Evidence**: Some files don't follow style guidelines
- **Impact**: Reduced code maintainability
- **Recommended Fix**: Apply consistent linting rules
- **Owner**: Code quality team
