## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Proof Automation Optimization
- **Replace Global `simp`**: Use `simp [only]` with specific lemmas
- **Add Specialized Lemmas**: Create targeted lemmas for common patterns
- **Optimize `aesop` Usage**: Limit search depth and add safe rules
- **Reduce Unification Goals**: Break complex proofs into smaller steps

### 2. Memory Management
- **Limit Proof Depth**: Set reasonable limits for proof search
- **Optimize Data Structures**: Use efficient representations for large objects
- **Cache Management**: Optimize Lean's internal caching mechanisms

### 3. Build System Optimization
- **Parallel Compilation**: Enable parallel building where possible
- **Incremental Builds**: Optimize Lake's incremental build system
- **Dependency Optimization**: Minimize unnecessary dependency downloads

## Measurement Methodology

### Build Performance
```bash
# Measure total build time
time lake build

# Measure memory usage
/usr/bin/time -v lake build

# Profile specific components
lake build --verbose
```

### Proof Performance
```lean
-- Enable performance profiling
set_option trace.profiler true

-- Measure specific proof
set_option trace.Elab.info true
```

### Automated Benchmarking
```bash
# Run performance tests
./scripts/benchmark.sh

# Generate performance report
./scripts/performance-report.sh
```
